Projects

This is a repo with some projects I have been working on in my spare time.
Primarily working on data visualization, Data cleaning, Decriptive stastitics and ML algorithms.

Datasets used were located online from Kaggle, global gadget consumption, Wisconsin breast cancer diagnoses and supply chain data from Data core.

All visulizations are located as well as the code for each in python conducted on Visual code.
