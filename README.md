This is a repo with some projects I have been working on in my spare time.
Primarily working on data visualization, Data cleaning and Decriptive stastitics
Also perfomed predictive analysis on a number of variables for the top 10 countries over 5 years

I also worked on a machine learning project utilizing the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset to determine predictive values
