📦 Supply Chain Shipping Delay Prediction
This project explores a real-world supply chain dataset to predict shipping delays using machine learning. It demonstrates a full data science pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and model evaluation.

🔍 Objective
To predict shipping delays based on various customer, product, and order-related features. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help businesses optimize logistics and reduce delivery time variance.

🧠 Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, date parsing, feature engineering

Feature Engineering: Created new variables like shipping_days_taken and shipping_delay

Machine Learning: Trained a RandomForestRegressor to predict shipping delays

Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, and visualizations of prediction error

Data Visualization: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore data and model results

📊 Libraries Used
pandas, numpy – Data wrangling

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

📁 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from a fictional e-commerce supply chain operation. It includes order dates, shipping times, customer and product info, and delivery performance metrics.
